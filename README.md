# Transparent Lottery

Generation of pseudo-random numbers from a public, verifiable algorithm using Bitcoin network hashes.
With this innovation, betting games, raffles, and prizes can benefit from the transparency of the draws, ensuring that there will be no manipulation of the results.
Anyone can verify the operation, making the process transparent.

The Bitcoin network generates a new block approximately every 10 minutes. Each block has a unique identifier called a "hash". This hash is essentially a very long, random-looking string of letters and numbers.
Transparent Lottery uses these unpredictable Bitcoin block hashes as the seed for its random number generation.
This means that the outcome of any lottery draw is determined by a public, verifiable, and immutable source â€“ the Bitcoin blockchain.
